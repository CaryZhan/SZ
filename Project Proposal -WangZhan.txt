# STA130 Project Personal Proposal - CSCS Data Analysis


### Analysis 1: UCLA Loneliness Scale & Life Satisfaction

## Research question

**What is the relationship between loneliness and overall life satisfaction? Is there a significant difference in life satisfaction between those who score high vs. low on the loneliness scale?

**Variables:
-LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score: Composite loneliness score.
-WELLNESS_life_satisfaction: Self-reported life satisfaction on a 1-10 scale.

## My analysis plan

1. Box plot: showing life satisfaction distributions for different loneliness score groups
   (will categorize loneliness scores into low/medium/high based on quartiles).
2. Scatter plot: with curve showing relationship between raw scores.
3. Summary statistics (mean, median, SD) of life satisfaction for each loneliness group.

These visualizations will help understand both the continuous relationship and categorical differences
in life satisfaction across loneliness levels.

Pay attention to:
1. Normality within groups
2. Homogeneity of variances
3. Independence of observations

## Expected results

I hypothesize that individuals with higher loneliness scores will report significantly lower life satisfaction.

Expect to see:
1. Clear negative trend in scatter plot.
2. Meaningful differences between high and low loneliness groups in the test.

Results would provide evidence for the impact of loneliness on overall well-being and could help
identify threshold levels of loneliness that are particularly associated with decreased life satisfaction.


### Analysis 2: Social Support & Emotional Loneliness

## Research question

**What is the relationship between perceived social support and emotional loneliness? Is there a significant negative correlation as theory would suggest?

**Variables:
-PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_scale_score
-LONELY_dejong_emotional_loneliness_sub_scale_score

## My analysis plan

1. Scatter plot with regression line to visualize relationship
2. Correlation matrix heatmap including subscales of social support
3. Descriptive statistics for both measures

These will help understand the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

Simple linear regression with:
- Dependent variable: Emotional loneliness score
- Independent variable: Social support score

Will assess:
1. R-squared value for model fit
2. Regression coefficient significance
3. Residual analysis for assumptions

## Expected results

May find a significant negative relationship between social support and emotional loneliness.
Higher social support scores should predict lower emotional loneliness scores. This would validate
theoretical frameworks and indicates the importance of social support interventions.


### Analysis 3: Changes in COVID-19 Prevention Behaviors

## Research question

**What proportion of participants maintained strict COVID-19 prevention practices between 2021 and 2022? 
Construct 95% confidence interval for this population parameter.

**Using variables:
-COVID_prevention_masks
-COVID_prevention_distancing
-COVID_prevention_hand_washing

## Planned visualization & summary statistics

1. Stacked bar charts showing prevention behavior distributions
2. Contingency tables comparing 2021 vs 2022 responses
3. Summary of consistency in responses across years

These will help visualize changes in prevention behaviors over time.

## My analysis plan

1. Create composite prevention score from multiple measures
2. Calculate proportion maintaining "Very closely" responses
3. Construct 95% confidence interval using:
   -Normal approximation method for proportion
   -Wilson score interval for more accurate bounds

## Expected results

Expect to find that a significant proportion (perhaps 40-60%) maintained strict prevention practices,
but with a decline from 2021 to 2022. The confidence interval will provide a plausible range for the
true population proportion and help inform public health messaging strategies.
